Hello this is a repository to showcase some of the projects I have or am working on!

Charlotte Banking (Banking website group project):

https://github.com/ITCS3112/blazor-bankingp

This project was for a class where we learned more about C# and Object oriented programming. Our group decided we wanted to make a Banking website using .NETs Blazor which allowed us to easily incorporate C# with HTML and CSS. Our project included many features such as: User data securely kept in a Supabase Database we created, a way for the user to see the neccessary information on their money, a way to deposit/withdraw, separation between admins and users, different account types for what the user needed and much more. I learned a lot not only about C# but also .NET and Supabase which I feel has helped me a lot in learning other things. The three of us all contributed fairly equally and all did a lot. The main things I worked on were the database and connecting it to the code, multiple of the pages and design of the website, and the user/admin separation. This project was very worth while and has taught me a lot about working in a group format.
