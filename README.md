Hello this is a repository to showcase some of the projects I have or am working on!

CURRENT PROJECTS:
Scorcher - Web Scraping searcher (August 2025 -- Present):
https://github.com/ZVogel1/Scorcher-Product_Filtering_Site

This is an ongoing personal project where I am attempting to create a web application that allows for product filtering. When a user searches for a product on Scorcher, it will scrape Google Shop to find the top three products that match the searched term. These products will be rated based on certain parameters like price, reviews, and others. These products will be returned to the Scorcher website so that the user can see the three a long with each having an AI summary from a third-party API. Users will be able to sing in/up to their account so that they can add the products they like to their wish-list. This project will be a full stack web app using: Flask, Python, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I want to do this as it will teach me more about full stack development and also allow me to learn Flask while getting better at Python and SQL.

PAST PROJECTS:
Charlotte Banking (Banking website group project) (January 2025 -- May 2025:

https://github.com/ITCS3112/blazor-bankingp

This project was for a class where we learned more about C# and Object oriented programming. Our group decided we wanted to make a Banking website using .NETs Blazor which allowed us to easily incorporate C# with HTML and CSS. Our project included many features such as: User data securely kept in a Supabase Database we created, a way for the user to see the neccessary information on their money, a way to deposit/withdraw, separation between admins and users, different account types for what the user needed and much more. I learned a lot not only about C# but also .NET and Supabase which I feel has helped me a lot in learning other things. The three of us all contributed fairly equally and all did a lot. The main things I worked on were the database and connecting it to the code, multiple of the pages and design of the website, and the user/admin separation. This project was very worth while and has taught me a lot about working in a group format.
